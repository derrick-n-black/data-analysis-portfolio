# Derrick's Data Analysis Portfolio

# [Backpack Beginnings Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/Backpack-Beginnings)
This was my final graduate research project, submitted to the Department of Mathematics at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University as a requirement of graduation for the Master of Science in Applied Mathematics.
* Backpack Beginnings, a nonprofit providing food services to schoolchildren, is looking to expand to new local schools.
* Initial data cleaning was done in Excel; analysis and predictive modeling done in RStudio.
* Full version of findings and recommendations (for Department of Mathematics) can be viewed [here](Backpack%20Beginnings/Black,%20D.%20-%20Investigating%20the%20Current%20Trend%20and%20Predicting%20the%20Future%20Needs%20for%20BackPack%20Programs%20-%20BackPack%20Beginnings%20in%20Guilford%20County,%20North%20Carolina.pdf).
* Shortened, published version of findings and recommendations (for 2019 International Conference on Data Science) can be viewed [here](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10108840).
* This project was supported by the National Science Foundation National Research Traineeship Project: Improving Strategies for Hunger Relief and Food Security using Computational Data Science ([Award No. DGE-1735258](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1735258)).

# [Data Analytics with SQL - New Wheels Case Study](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/New-Wheels)
This project was from the "Data Analytics with SQL" course from the *Data Analytics Essentials* program (Great Learning - The University of Texas at Austin, Texas Executive Education).
* Declining sales reported at New Wheels company; data analyst insight needed.
* Initial data queries were done using MySQL [here](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/New%20Wheels/submission_Derrick_Black.sql).
* Queries from MySQL were transferred to Microsoft Excel to make visualizations for the report.
* Key metrics, visualizations, and recommendations were given in a [Quarterly Business Report](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/New%20Wheels/submission_Derrick_Black_Slides.pdf).
* This project allowed me to display skills in querying and aggregating data in many different ways in MySQL, producing insightful graphs from those queries in Excel, and summarizing the analysis in an easy-to-understand set of report slides.

# [Data-driven Insights using Python - FoodHub Case Study](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/FoodHub)
This project was from the "Data-driven Insights using Python" course from the *Data Analytics Essentials* program (Great Learning - The University of Texas at Austin, Texas Executive Education).
* Data from FoodHub food delivery service was used to gain insights regarding customer demand and improving the customer experience.
* Thorough Python analysis done with Google Colaboratory [here](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/FoodHub/FoodHub%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb).
* This project strengthened my skills in using Python libraries to explore data, clean data, and perform univariate and multivariate analyses through visualizations.
* Through this exploration of the data, I was able to give good suggestions to the company to strengthen or improve observed trends.

# [Creative Storytelling with Tableau - Gamers' Arena Case Study](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/Gamers-Arena)
This project was from the "Creative Storytelling with Tableau" course from the *Data Analytics Essentials* program (Great Learning - The University of Texas at Austin, Texas Executive Education).
* Data analyst insight needed for decision regarding a new subscription model.
* Interactive visualization dashboard, created with Tableau, is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/derrick.black/viz/Project-GamersArena-DerrickBlack/GamersArenaDashboard?publish=yes).
* This project allowed me to show creativity in selecting the types of visualizations used and in designing the overall layout of the dashboard.
* Skills acquired and strengthened in this project include the application of filters, parameters, calculated fields, etc. to allow users to alter dashboards to highlight their areas of interest.
