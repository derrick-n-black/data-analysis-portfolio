# Derrick's Data Analysis Portfolio

# [Data Analytics with SQL - New Wheels Case Study](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/New-Wheels)
This project was from the "Data Analytics with SQL" course from the *Data Analytics Essentials* program (Great Learning - The University of Texas at Austin, Texas Executive Education).
* Declining sales reported at New Wheels company; data analyst insight needed.
* Initial data queries were done using MySQL [here](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/New%20Wheels/submission_Derrick_Black.sql).
* Queries from MySQL were transferred to Microsoft Excel to make visualizations for the report.
* Key metrics, visualizations, and recommendations were given in a [Quarterly Business Report](https://github.com/derrick-n-black/data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/New%20Wheels/submission_Derrick_Black_Slides.pdf).
* This project allowed me to display skills in querying and aggregating data in many different ways in MySQL, producing insightful graphs from those queries in Excel, and summarizing the analysis in an easy-to-understand set of report slides.
